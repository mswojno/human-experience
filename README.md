The Human Experience Project spawned from me intent to create a blog a in the summer of 2018. I wanted to bring my thoughts about various human experiences and concepts to paper for everyone to see. That blog gave me inspiration to create an Open Source project to combat mental health. This project/movement is geared toward eventually providing resources to any person in need. We all go through similar experiences and tragic events. So, I want to provide resources for the major human experiences to either further advance the good ones or to help aide the bad ones. Stay tuned to this project and watch it grow from its initial start. I will try to work on this during my free time and am open to any sort of help. Hope you enjoy!
